## Code Contributions

If you want to help out and make RuneCord better for everyone, you should fork this repository, make your changes, and then send in a pull request.

Before you make your pull request, please ensure you follow these guidelines:
* Use spaces instead of tabs.
* Use only `2` spaces for indentation.
* Please ensure all tests pass when you do `npm test`.
* All PRs **must** pass on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/unlucky4ever/RuneCord).
* Update the [README](https://github.com/unlucky4ever/RuneCord/blob/master/README.md) if you add any new commands.
* Please **do not change** the version number or add to [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/unlucky4ever/RuneCord/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

I recommend using Atom as your text editor, and installing the package [editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) so you don't have to change your global settings for indentation.
